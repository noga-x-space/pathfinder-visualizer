 implement the wall nodes to work in:
1-whatever node is in the wall history should be marked as isWall (node properties)
2-any node in the wallHistory (they should all be marked) should be painted black
3-while the mouse is still hovering, the nodes selected in the wallOn mode should be yellow, turning to black once
